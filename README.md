The common sense code of conduct.

## Content

[The common sense code of conduct](https://github.com/replicadse/cscoc/edit/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Why

- Other code of conducts make it arbitrarily complex to have a discussion or be honest
- I respect no one by default. Respect has to be earned.
- Respect is not equal to not being an asshole. There is a difference between polite and respectful.
- If I think that something is shitty, I am going to say that without having to worry about whether I hurt someone's feelings. If you can not handle critics then the solution is not to keep everyone from voicing theirs.
